	<button class="accordion" style="color: #8c1515; opacity: 0.8;">
	  Abstract
	</button>
	</p>
	<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">  To explain the simultaneous increase in the skill premium and the share of hours worked by skilled workers between 1980 and 2000, economists have concluded that there must have been a rapid expansion in skilled labor demand over this period. Mounting evidence suggests that since 2000, growth in skilled labor demand has slowed down. This slowdown raises challenges for the main explanations for the initial increase in the skill premium. Models emphasizing skill-biased technical change require a slowdown in the relative labor productivity of skilled workers post 2000, which seems implausible. Models emphasizing capital-skill complementarity and a declining relative price of capital predict steady increases in skilled labor demand, given that the relative price of capital has continued to decline over this period. I propose a dynamic macroeconomic model that can reconcile the initial rise in the skill premium with the subsequent slowdown, via a simple mechanism: the initial rising relative price of skilled workers generates incentives for firms to adopt capital-intensive technologies which economize on the use of skilled labor. In the model, this simultaneously slows down growth in skilled labor demand and, by reducing the costs associated with employing capital with skilled labor, allows firms to substitute away from unskilled workers as well. The model can account endogenously for the slowing growth in the skill premium, a stable labor share and the reallocation of value added toward low labor share firms.</div>

	<button class="accordion" style="color: #8c1515; opacity: 0.8;">
	  Abstract
	</button>
	</p>
	<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We examine patterns of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) around national elections in 23 countries. Uncertainty shows a clear tendency to rise in the months leading up to elections. Average EPU values are 13% higher in the month of and the month prior to an election than in other months of the same national election cycle, conditional on country effects, time effects, and country-specific time trends. In a closer examination of U.S. data, EPU rises by 28% in the month of presidential elections that are close and polarized, as compared to elections that are neither. This pattern suggests that the 2020 US Presidential Election could see a large rise in economic policy uncertainty. It also suggests larger spikes in uncertainty around future elections in other countries that have experienced rising polarization in recent years. </div>

  <br />with Martin Souchier<br>
	<button class="accordion" style="color: #8c1515; opacity: 0.8;">
	  Abstract
	</button>
	</p>
	<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We argue that "Zombie lending‚Äù, where banks keep lending to insolvent and unproductive firms, attenuates the effects of recessions in the short-run at the expense of output in the long-run. We build a quantitative model in which heterogeneous firms finance themselves through retained earnings and bank debt. Banks face capital requirements, but have private information on whether a given loan is in default, allowing them to hide losses and bypass these requirements. In a recession, higher firm defaults lead to larger bank losses, raising the incentives to hide losses by keeping insolvent firms alive. In the short-run this allows banks to keep lending, which supports output. In the long-run however, this leads to misallocation due to the survival of relatively unfit firms and lower entry. We use the model to quantify the contribution of zombie lending during and after the 2008-09 crisis in Europe and to evaluate the implications of pro-cyclical capital requirements. </div>

  <button class="accordion" style="color: #8c1515; opacity: 0.8;">
	  Abstract
	</button>
	</p>
	<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Although AI is increasingly applicable to business tasks, AI adoption remains low and concentrated in large firms, which increases inequality across firms and workers at those firms. We identify the key barriers to AI adoption as the high costs of AI customization to specific business needs of complementary data infrastructure needed to leverage AI. We propose two clusters of policies to lower AI adoption costs for small and medium enterprises (SME). First, we propose public support targeted at the creation and commercialization of flexible low/no-code AI platforms. Second, we propose creating public data repositories and a clearinghouse-like infrastructure to improve SME access to cutting edge pre-trained models and computational infrastructure. We also propose the creation of a medium-skilled data curator workforce to manage and reuse data and provide new opportunities for retrained¬†workers. </div>
