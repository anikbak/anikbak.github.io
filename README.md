# Aniket's Website

## Introduction
It's not like I know any HTML or even any economics, for that matter, but I did manage to scrap together a bunch of codes from different sources and figure out some basics to put this website together. Some sources I consulted and got files from: 

* Source files for my friend Daniele's website, at [``https://danicaratelli.github.io``](https://github.com/danicaratelli/danicaratelli.github.io).
* Github's "Light" style, css files available at [``https://github.com/primer/github-syntax-light``](https://github.com/primer/github-syntax-light).
* OpenDyslexic fonts, available at [``https://github.com/antijingoist/opendyslexic``](https://github.com/antijingoist/opendyslexic).
